This is the CPT project of Eric Zheng, Leo Yang, and Jerry Wang of the ICS3U period 3 class.


Our game is a simple tower defense game where the goal is to use points that you earn from defeating enemies to buy towers that will help you defend your base. Each hitpoint left on an opponent that reaches your base will be subtracted from the hitpoints of your base. When your base hitpoint is 0, you lose.
